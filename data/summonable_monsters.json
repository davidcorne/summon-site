The mere sight of its own face—reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water—is enough to send a wrecker demon into a rage.

Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.\n\n\n\nBlack dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They're immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.\n\n\n\nBlack dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can't survive the dragon's acidic presence.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Acid","Amphibious","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +22","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":20,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":23,"fort_misc":null,"ref":18,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":215,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["acid","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 28","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 28 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.\n\n\n\nNot all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.\n\n\n\nBlue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.\n\n\n\nThe ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 31","level":13,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Huge","traits":["LE","Huge","Dragon","Electricity"],"senses":["Perception +24","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Auran","Common","Draconic","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":24,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Sound Imitation","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The dragon can mimic any sound it has heard.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.\n\n\n\nThese carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.\n\n\n\nThough they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.\n\n\n\nMost brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Large","traits":["CG","Large","Dragon","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +21","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Auran","Common","Draconic","Gnomish","Halfling","Sylvan","speak with animals"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":19,"misc":null}],"perception":21,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":215,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 28","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 28 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.\n\n\n\nDepending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.\n\n\n\nAlthough brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 32\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 32","level":12,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"LN","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","LN","Huge","Amphibious","Dragon","Elemental","Water"],"senses":["Perception +23","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":23,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":6},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":33,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":25,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":222,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["acid","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 30","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 30 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.\n\n\n\nBronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.\n\n\n\nWhile all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 31","level":13,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Huge","traits":["LG","Huge","Amphibious","Dragon","Water"],"senses":["Perception +23","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic","Dwarven","Elven","Gnomish","speak with animals"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":23,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":5,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":34,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":24,"fort_misc":null,"ref":23,"ref_misc":null,"will":26,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":260,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["electricity","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Electricity Aura","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","electricity"],"description":"10 feet, 1d12 electricity damage.

Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.\n\n\n\nA cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.\n\n\n\nCloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 34\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 34","level":14,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","N","Huge","Air","Dragon","Elemental"],"senses":["Perception +28","darkvision","mist vision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Auran","Common","Draconic","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":26,"misc":null}],"perception":28,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":6,"cha_mod":6},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Mist Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Fog and mist don't impair a cloud dragon's vision; they ignore the __concealed__ condition from fog and mist.","raw_description":"**Mist Vision** Fog and mist don't impair a cloud dragon's vision; they ignore the __concealed__ condition from fog and mist.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":36,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":26,"fort_misc":null,"ref":23,"ref_misc":null,"will":26,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":254,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["electricity","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 32","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 32 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.\n\n\n\nCopper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.\n\n\n\nA copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 30","level":12,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Large","traits":["CG","Large","Dragon","Earth"],"senses":["Perception +23","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Elven","Gnomish"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":23,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":33,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":23,"fort_misc":null,"ref":22,"ref_misc":null,"will":22,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":235,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["acid","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 29","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 29 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\n\n\nCrystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.\n\n\n\nAlthough crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 30\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 30","level":11,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"NG","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","NG","Huge","Dragon","Earth","Elemental"],"senses":["Perception +20","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Terran","Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":20,"misc":null}],"perception":20,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":33,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":24,"fort_misc":null,"ref":19,"ref_misc":null,"will":20,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":185,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"sonic"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 30","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 30 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.\n\n\n\nWhen another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.\n\nA gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.\n\nGold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 34","level":15,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Huge","traits":["LG","Huge","Dragon","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +29","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Dwarven","Elven","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":29,"misc":null},{"name":"Medicine ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":29,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":26,"misc":null}],"perception":29,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":5,"wis_mod":6,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":38,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":28,"fort_misc":null,"ref":25,"ref_misc":null,"will":28,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":330,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":15,"type":"cold"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 33","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 33 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.\n\n\n\nThough more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.\n\n\n\nGreen dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.\n\n\n\nTheir hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 30","level":12,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Huge","traits":["LE","Huge","Amphibious","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +22","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Elven","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":34,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":20,"fort_misc":null,"ref":22,"ref_misc":null,"will":23,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":215,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","poison","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 31","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 31 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.\n\n\n\nRed dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.\n\n\n\nDriven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.\n\n\n\nAs legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.\n\n\n\nSilver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.\n\n\n\nSilver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.\n\n\n\nMany silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 32","level":14,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Huge","traits":["LG","Huge","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +26","darkvision","fog vision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic","Dwarven"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Medicine ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":20,"misc":null}],"perception":26,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Fog Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The silver dragon ignores the concealed condition from fog and clouds.","raw_description":"**Fog Vision** The silver dragon ignores the concealed condition from fog and clouds.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":37,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":26,"fort_misc":null,"ref":23,"ref_misc":null,"will":28,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":295,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 33","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 33 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.\n\n\n\nFor all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 36","level":15,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","NE","Huge","Dragon","Shadow"],"senses":["Perception +29","greater darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Necril","Shadowtongue"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":31,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":28,"misc":null}],"perception":29,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":6,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":37,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":27,"fort_misc":null,"ref":25,"ref_misc":null,"will":27,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":275,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["negative","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 34","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 34 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.\n\n\n\nThankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +20","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","snow vision"],"languages":["Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":18,"misc":null}],"perception":20,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Snow Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","raw_description":"**Snow Vision** Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":29,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":19,"ref_misc":null,"will":17,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":215,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Dragon Chill","action_cost":"None","traits":["arcane","aura","cold","evocation"],"description":"5 feet, 2d6 cold damage (DC 27 basic Reflex)","raw_description":"**Dragon Chill** (__arcane__, __aura__, __cold__, __evocation__); 5 feet, 2d6 cold damage (DC 27 basic Reflex)","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 27","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 27 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.\n\n\n\nThankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 36","level":15,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","CE","Huge","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +30","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","snow vision"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":31,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":26,"misc":null}],"perception":30,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":7,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Snow Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","raw_description":"**Snow Vision** Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":36,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":30,"fort_misc":null,"ref":26,"ref_misc":null,"will":24,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":330,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":15,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Blizzard","action_cost":"None","traits":["arcane","aura","cold"],"description":"50 feet.

Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.\n\n\n\nAs it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.\n\n\n\nMature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Mindless","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +10","tremorsense 30 feet","low-light vision"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":9,"misc":"+11 in forests or grasslands"}],"perception":10,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":0,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-5,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Camouflage","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The assassin vine can __Hide__ in natural environments even if it doesn't have cover.","raw_description":"**Camouflage** The assassin vine can __Hide__ in natural environments even if it doesn't have cover.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":10,"fort_misc":null,"ref":7,"ref_misc":null,"will":8,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":68,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"fire"},{"amount":5,"type":"slashing"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Grasping Foliage","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":["primal","transmutation"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Grasping Foliage [Reaction]** (__primal__, __transmutation__) **Trigger **The assassin vine detects a creature within 20 feet via __tremorsense__; **Effect **The assassin vine causes vegetation within a 20-foot emanation to writhe for 1 round, turning this area into difficult terrain.

Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach's upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach's fangs.\n\n\n\nAthachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of settled territories until they find a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes on a final rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature they can find. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape, forcing these terrified victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading word of the athach's fearsomeness.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 30","level":12,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Huge","traits":["CE","Huge","Giant","Humanoid"],"senses":["Perception +22","darkvision"],"languages":["Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":7,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":33,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":25,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":250,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"An athach gains an extra reaction at the start of each of its turns that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity with its claw.

Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.\n\n\n\nAurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition.

Their legs and claws are smaller than those of most dragons, but their powerful undulating coils, like those of a boa constrictor, are potent weapons capable of squeezing the life from several unfortunate victims at a time.\n\n\n\nA bida uses its impressive intellect and powerful magic to pose as a humanoid and infiltrate a settlement. Over the course of weeks or months, it establishes itself as a key member of the village, and only after it has become invaluable to the community does it reveal the terrible price of its assistance: regular offerings of flesh and gold. From this point on, the bida dwells almost exclusively within its smoggy lair, growing fat off the blood of its sacrificial offerings. To hide its presence from the outside world, a bida conceals its enslaved settlement in a large-scale illusion, leaving only a stand of jungle trees where once a thriving village may have been and ordering the townsfolk to destroy any roads in and out of town.\n\n\n\nBidas begrudgingly tolerate others of their kind, instead preferring the company of their small, tasty thralls. In rare cases, a pair of bidas may join forces to conquer a particularly large settlement, extracting that much more wealth (and blood) from the populace as a result of their partnership.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 26","level":8,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","LE","Huge","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +15","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Mwangi"],"skills":[{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":16,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":6},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":27,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":18,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":18,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+2 circumstance to all saves to disbelieve illusions"},"hp":135,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"acid"},{"amount":10,"type":"poison"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":20,"type":"climb"},{"amount":60,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":20,"traits":["reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d12+9","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tail","to_hit":20,"traits":["reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+9","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Improved Grab"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Occult Innate Spells","dc":26,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"nondetection","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"humanoid form","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Constrict","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"1d6+6 bludgeoning, DC 26","raw_description":"**Constrict**   1d6+6 bludgeoning, DC 26","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Eight Coils","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A bida can Strike with its tail even while Grabbing creatures with it.

Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.\n\n\n\nBlindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.\n\n\n\nIt's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. __Duergars__ use them as \"raid frogs,\" placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. __Drow__ use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Small","traits":["N","Small","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":6,"misc":"+9 to Leap or Swim"},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":7,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":2,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":5,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":27,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["blinded","light"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"},{"amount":15,"type":"climb"},{"amount":15,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":10,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d12+2","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":11,"traits":["agile","finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+2","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Spotlight","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["concentrate","light"],"description":"Bright light shines from the blindheim's eyes in a 30-foot emanation (also creating dim light to 60 feet).

The species originated from a type of large feral boar native to Nidal's shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors' gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce blood boars—augmented by the selective application of magic—grants the creatures an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a bloodied creature's location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey from up to a mile away.\n\n\n\nBlood boars' keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen through the boar's ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible.\n\n\n\nA blood boar's ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target's blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover, but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom. Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar's pursuit if it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid accidental bloodshed during an escape.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +15","bloodsense 60 feet","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":15,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Bloodsense","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The blood boar can precisely sense bleeding creatures within 60 feet.","raw_description":"**Bloodsense** The blood boar can precisely sense bleeding creatures within 60 feet.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Blood Quarry","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"On smelling a creature's blood, the blood boar can designate that creature as its quarry.

Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge,\" possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge,\" comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.\n\n\n\nBloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.\n\n\n\nMost humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.\n\n\n\nA typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it   ies off to digest its meal.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 13","level":-1,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Tiny","traits":["N","Tiny","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +6","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":6,"misc":null}],"perception":6,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":0,"int_mod":-5,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":16,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":5,"fort_misc":null,"ref":8,"ref_misc":null,"will":4,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":6,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":10,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"barbed leg","to_hit":8,"traits":["finesse"],"damage":null,"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Attach","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When a bloodseeker hits a target larger than itself, its barbed legs attach it to that creature.

In addition, each member of the community is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of the species.

They have little interest in worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of deep space as worthy of faith and fear.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 26","level":8,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +18","darkvision"],"languages":["Abyssal","Aklo","Common","Draconic","Protean","Undercommon","telepathy 100 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Lore ","bonus":18,"misc":"all subcategories"},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":26,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":15,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":18,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":140,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["confused"],"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":"brain loss"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Brain Blisters","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A brain collector has seven brain blisters on its back that it uses to house stolen brains.

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.\n\n\n\nWhen facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.\n\n\n\nHonest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear __wolves__, and they avoid farms with dogs.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 15","level":1,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Tiny","traits":["N","Tiny","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +7","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Elven","Gnomish","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":5,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":9,"misc":null}],"perception":7,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-2,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["shortsword"],"ac":16,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":4,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":9,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":25,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":3,"type":"<a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"Equipment.aspx?ID=272\">cold iron</a>"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"shortsword","to_hit":7,"traits":["agile","finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6","type":null},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":17,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"dimension door","frequency":"self only","requirement":null}]},{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"mending","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"ventriloquism","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":4,"spells":[{"name":"dancing lights","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"prestidigitation","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Baffling Bluff","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["emotion","enchantment","mental","primal"],"description":"The brownie's antics can confuse and disorient a creature.

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname \"landshark.\"\n\n\n\nA typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.\n\n\n\nThe first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf—a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 24","level":8,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":20,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":14,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":120,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"burrow"},{"amount":null,"type":"powerful jumper"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Jaws","to_hit":21,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"2d10+10","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Claw","to_hit":21,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+10","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Favored Prey","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A bulette gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack and damage rolls with its jaws against a specific type of creature designated as its favorite food.

Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk.\n\n\n\nDespite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.\n\n\n\nIn some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Animal","Aquatic"],"senses":["Perception +10","blood scent","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 100 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":10,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Blood Scent","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The bunyip can smell blood in the water from up to 1 mile away.","raw_description":"**Blood Scent** The bunyip can smell blood in the water from up to 1 mile away.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":6,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":45,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Aquatic Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"As Attack of Opportunity, but both the bunyip and the triggering creature must be in water.","raw_description":"**Aquatic Opportunity** [Reaction] As Attack of Opportunity, but both the bunyip and the triggering creature must be in water.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":10,"type":"Land"},{"amount":40,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Jaws","to_hit":11,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d10+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":"1d6","type":"persistent bleed damage"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Tail","to_hit":11,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+4","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Blood Frenzy","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Blood Frenzy** [Reaction]  **Requirements** The bunyip is not __fatigued__ or already in a frenzy. **Trigger** The bunyip deals __bleed damage__ to a living creature. **Effect** The bunyip flies into a frenzy that lasts 1 minute.

The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. A choker's long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep—it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.\n\n\n\nChokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Small","traits":["CE","Small","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +7","darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo","Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":"+11 to Grapple"},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":9,"misc":null}],"perception":7,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":7,"fort_misc":null,"ref":10,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":28,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Yank","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":["manipulate"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Yank [Reaction]** (__manipulate__) **Trigger **An enemy targets the choker with an attack; **Effect **The choker tries to pull a creature it has __grabbed__ or __restrained__ into the path of the attack.

At that point, they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive.\n\n\n\nChuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs the world over—even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands. While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose flavor and stink they find off-putting.\n\n\n\nChuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about how it will enjoy feasting on the creature's   esh. Perhaps chuuls believe that insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled by treats or pain.\n\n\n\nIt is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season. Chuuls' intellects seem devoted only toward eating, causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and victories, and breeding.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration","Amphibious"],"senses":["Perception +15","darkvision","tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Aklo","Common","(or Undercommon","for Darklands variants)"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":13,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":28,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":18,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":100,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["poison"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.\n\n\n\nLike many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation.\n\n\n\nBut there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 20","level":5,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Large","traits":["CN","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +12","darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo","Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Deception ","bonus":14,"misc":"+16 to Impersonate a cloak, sheet, or ray"},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":12,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Shadow Shift","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Cloakers are concealed in dim light even to creatures with low-light vision and darkvision.","raw_description":"**Shadow Shift** Cloakers are concealed in dim light even to creatures with low-light vision and darkvision.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":22,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":80,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":10,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":14,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d10+7","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tail","to_hit":14,"traits":["agile","reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+7","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Envelop","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["attack","incapacitation"],"description":"The cloaker makes an attack roll with a +14 bonus against an adjacent creature's Reflex DC.

Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral, but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It's not uncommon for such giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.\n\n\n\nLegends persist of floating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Air","Giant","Humanoid"],"senses":["Perception +22","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Common","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":0,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["+1 striking ranseur","sack with 5 rocks"],"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":25,"fort_misc":null,"ref":18,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":220,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Averaging 7 feet in height, D'ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termite-like abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have five-fingered hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.\n\n\n\nD'ziriaks' otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in D'ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and D'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized carefully over time to fit the individual's station.\n\n\n\nThe D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being \"butchered by fleshy throats.\" D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Aberration","Shadow"],"senses":["Perception +10","darkvision"],"languages":["D'ziriak","Shadowtongue","telepathy 100 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":10,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":6,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":10,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":45,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Glow","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","light"],"description":"20 feet.

They hunt for meat along the forest's understory when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon's ambulations are slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult to escape from.\n\n\n\nA hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes in a dezullon's digestive tract, once expelled, inflict a victim with powerful hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals who deal in poisons.\n\n\n\nMany varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid's tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech's teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous, since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become ensconced inside their pitchers.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +18","low-light vision"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":"+24 in forests or swamps"}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":7,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":21,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":130,"hp_misc":"regeneration 15 (deactivated by fire)","immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":20,"type":"acid"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Stench","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","olfactory"],"description":"30 feet.

The original doorwardens crafted by the elves included a motif of elven armor and a metal mask in the style of Alseta's own, though other cultures embellish their own doorwardens with their own themes and sometimes even their own ancestral weapons, such as axes for dwarven doorwardens.\n\n\n\nDoorwardens sometimes know about the chambers they guard, and they have been known to speak to trespassers, especially elves.

These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although they normally eat large fish, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon turtles, preparing to flee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange for safe passage.\n\n\n\nMost dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn't drift across the sea.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 26","level":9,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Amphibious","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +18","darkvision"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":0,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":29,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":19,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":140,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Shell Block","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Shell Block **[Reaction] **Trigger** A creature adjacent to the dragon turtle targets it with a melee attack. **Effect** The dragon turtle rolls its shell toward the triggering creature, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggering attack.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"A creature adjacent to the dragon turtle targets it with a melee attack.","effect":"The dragon turtle rolls its shell toward the triggering creature, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggering attack.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Jaws","to_hit":21,"traits":["reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d12+9","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"Claw","to_hit":21,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+9","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Breath Weapon","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["air","fire","primal"],"description":"The dragon turtle breathes a massive blast of steam that deals 10d6 fire damage to creatures within a 50-foot __cone__ (DC 27 basic Reflex save).

A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix's digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.\n\n\n\nThe drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn't above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.\n\n\n\nSome Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fungus__ (__Nature__)**: DC 26","level":9,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Fungus"],"senses":["Perception +17","darkvision","sporesight (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":17,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Sporesight","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The drakauthix exudes a cloud of spores that it uses to see.

Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp—the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.\n\n\n\nAlthough the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.\n\n\n\nMost driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +13","darkvision"],"languages":["Elven","Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":15,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["+1 composite longbow (20 arrows)","glaive"],"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":15,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":95,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":30,"type":"Land"},{"amount":20,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"glaive","to_hit":16,"traits":["deadly 1d8","forceful","reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+10","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"fangs","to_hit":16,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d6+10","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"drider venom"}]}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"composite longbow","to_hit":16,"traits":["deadly d10","magical","propulsive","range increment 100 feet","reload 0","volley 50 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+8","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"web","to_hit":15,"traits":["range increment 30 feet"],"damage":null,"plus_damage":null}],"spell_lists":[{"name":"Arcane Innate Spells","dc":20,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"clairvoyance","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"suggestion","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"clairaudience","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"dispel magic","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"levitate","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"darkness","frequency":"at will","requirement":null},{"name":"faerie fire","frequency":"at will","requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":3,"spells":[{"name":"dancing lights","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"detect magic","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]},{"name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","dc":24,"to_hit":17,"misc":"","spell_groups":[{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"fireball","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"acid arrow","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"invisibility","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"magic missile","frequency":"x2","requirement":null},{"name":"ray of enfeeblement","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":3,"spells":[{"name":"ghost sound","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"mage hand","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"ray of frost","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Drider Venom","action_cost":"None","traits":["poison"],"description":"**Saving Throw** DC 23 Fortitude;

Their forms ripple and billow with heat, and their eyes glow from within as if they contain tiny, flickering flames. The pungent scent of rotting leaves smoldering in a bonfire clings to their fur. Yet those who have the chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they infiict.\n\n\n\nElananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious hunters of the First World roam in packs called \"billows\" to take down large prey. Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey, but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end of the hunt—though, as selfish creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes often reserve one use of this ability, just in case.\n\n\n\nBecause of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting companions by __redcaps__, who go out of their way to befriend or make deals with these creatures. Redcaps also flnd great sport in hunts where competing elananxes chase a single creature. Although they're large enough to serve as mounts for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse!\n\n\n\nElananxes have a strange affinity to forest fires. Because they are immune to the damage caused by flickering flames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on fire, simply so they might experience the beauty of the flames combined with the inevitable pain such disasters inflict on other creatures.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Fey","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +14","darkvision"],"languages":["Sylvan","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":14,"misc":"+17 to Track"}],"perception":14,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":12,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":95,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire"],"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"cold iron"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Cinder Dispersal","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":["fire","primal","transmutation"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Cinder Dispersal** [Reaction] (__fire__, __primal__, __transmutation__); **Frequency** once per day. **Trigger** The elananx takes damage from a hostile source. **Effect** The elananx disperses into a cloud of smoke and cinders, filling its space and a 20-foot emanation.

Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAs rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.\n\n\n\nWhile elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward elasmosaurus like this finds its way into a city's sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become the stuff of urban legends.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +16","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Deep Breath","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The elasmosaurus can hold its breath for 2 hours.","raw_description":"**Deep Breath** The elasmosaurus can hold its breath for 2 hours.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":125,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Long Neck","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"An elasmosaurus's long neck allows it to interact with the surface while its body remains submerged underwater.

While it usually feeds on lizards, big insects, and other small creatures, the emperor bird is highly territorial and not afraid to attack larger prey. Its beak, resembling that of the much smaller peafowl, is exceptionally sharp, but its deadliest weapon is its tail—the long, whiplike blades of bone hidden among its tail feathers are a nasty surprise for any predator trying to sneak up on the bird.\n\n\n\nThe emperor bird was given its current name 2,000 years ago when Taldor's Sixth Army of Exploration ventured into the Mwangi Expanse. When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki.\n\n\n\nKeeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest.\n\n\n\nThe emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators. Not only are the feathers beautiful, but they are actually magical—a fact that has piqued the interest of alchemists and wizards alike, many of whom have spent decades capturing and breeding emperor birds in the hope of unlocking their arcane secrets. Mages stationed in the Mwangi Expanse will pay a pretty penny for intact feathers from these majestic creatures—or better yet, live specimens.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 18","level":2,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["Uncommon","N","Medium","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +8"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":7,"misc":null}],"perception":8,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":2,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":0,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":6,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":27,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":15,"type":"Land"},{"amount":20,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"beak","to_hit":11,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d10+2","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tail","to_hit":11,"traits":["agile","reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+3","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Dazzling Display","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["enchantment","mental","primal","visual"],"description":"The emperor bird flaps its mesmerizing wings.

The slovenly, violent giants known as ettins are proof enough of that.\n\n\n\nThe origin of these two-headed brutes is unknown, but few who encounter ettins ponder their beginnings for long. Rather, the first priority for most creatures during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins' notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one—ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin's two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn't dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of their life as their own self.\n\n\n\nEttins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings—although most interlocutors simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway. The monsters are notoriously short tempered and, despite their heightened visual perception, short sighted in matters of keeping their allies alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Giant","Humanoid"],"senses":["Perception +16","low-light vision"],"languages":["pidgin of Goblin","Jotun","and Orcish"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":10,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":-1,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Independent Brains","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Each of an ettin's heads rolls its own initiative and has its own turn.

Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh 350 pounds or more.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fiend__ (__Religion__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Medium","traits":["LE","Medium","Fiend","Velstrac"],"senses":["Perception +13","greater darkvision","painsight"],"languages":["Common","Infernal","Shadowtongue"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Torture Lore ","bonus":12,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Painsight","action_cost":"None","traits":["divination","divine"],"description":"A velstrac automatically knows whether a creature it sees has any of the __doomed__, __dying__, and __wounded__ conditions, as well as the value of those conditions","raw_description":"**Painsight** (__divination__, __divine__) A velstrac automatically knows whether a creature it sees has any of the __doomed__, __dying__, and __wounded__ conditions, as well as the value of those conditions","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":15,"fort_misc":null,"ref":14,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":90,"hp_misc":"regeneration 10 (deactivated by good or silver","immunities":["cold"],"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"good"},{"amount":5,"type":"silver"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Unnerving Gaze","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","divine","enchantment","fear","mental","visual"],"description":"30 feet.

These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.\n\n\n\nBy instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all local resources.\n\n\n\nAn ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker's presence, though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Medium","traits":["CE","Medium","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +10","darkvision"],"languages":["Alghollthu","Aquan","Common","tongues"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Thievery ","bonus":9,"misc":null}],"perception":10,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["longsword","studded leather armor"],"ac":21,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+2 status to all saves vs. auditory and visual"},"hp":60,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"bludgeoning"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"longsword","to_hit":14,"traits":["versatile P"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+6","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":12,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+6","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Occult Innate Spells","dc":19,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":-1,"heightened_level":5,"spells":[{"name":"tongues","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Assume Form","action_cost":"None","traits":["concentrate","occult","polymorph","transmutation"],"description":"The faceless stalker spends 10 minutes reshaping its appearance to take on the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid.

They flit about on iridescent butterfly wings, the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural camouflage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets.\n\n\n\nFaerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments, though they have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those around them. In search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to wounding malice. While often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not years planning the perfect prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves to faerie dragons and may create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon's reputation as a trickster leads many to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons have cordial relationships.\n\n\n\nPeaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with hostility, they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes, diffusing the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conflict escalates, they target their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape. If their companions are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat changes. Faerie dragons protect their friends by any means available, including physical combat.\n\n\n\nSometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World grows stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance, these faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such faerie dragons increase in strength as appropriate—a faerie dragon of 20th level or even higher is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th level or higher beyond the most remote regions of the First World. When creating a more powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and grant it a number of primal spells known appropriate for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don't grow much larger, regardless of how powerful they become. Those who would seek to torment or vex a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as it's often difficult to tell how powerful one of these tiny dragons truly is at a simple glance!\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 18","level":2,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Tiny","traits":["Uncommon","CG","Tiny","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Sylvan","telepathy 100 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":4,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-2,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":0,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":0,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":5,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":30,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":15,"type":"Land"},{"amount":40,"type":"fly"},{"amount":20,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":10,"traits":["magical","finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Arcane Innate Spells","dc":21,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"invisibility","frequency":"self only","requirement":null}]}]},{"name":"Arcane Spontaneous Spells","dc":18,"to_hit":10,"misc":"","spell_groups":[{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"grease","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"illusory object","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"sleep","frequency":"4 slots","requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":1,"spells":[{"name":"dancing lights","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"ghost sound","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"prestidigitation","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"tanglefoot","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"telekinetic projectile","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Breath Weapon","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["arcane","evocation","poison"],"description":"The dragon breathes euphoric gas in a 10-foot cone.

A typical fire giant stands 12 to 16 feet tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Large","traits":["LE","Large","Fire","Giant","Humanoid"],"senses":["Perception +18","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":23,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":0,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["+1 striking greatsword","+1 half-plate","sack with 5 rocks"],"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":23,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":18,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":175,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Although a frost drake can wreak much destruction on its own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common.\n\n\n\nA frost drake's hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes feature sporadic patches of violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes'; when a frost drake is inhaling in preparation to launch its signature frozen breath, the monster's ice-blue blood can be seen beneath its scales.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +14","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet","snow vision"],"languages":["Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":15,"misc":null}],"perception":14,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Snow Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Snow doesn't impair a frost drake's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","raw_description":"**Snow Vision** Snow doesn't impair a frost drake's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":14,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":115,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","unconscious"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Retaliatory Strike","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Retaliatory Strike** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within reach of the frost drake's tail successfully damages the frost drake with a Strike. **Effect** The frost drake attempts to Strike with its tail.

Embodiments of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can't stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes' music and its ability to sway the heart.\n\n\n\nThe majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals. Gancanaghs enjoy using this flexibility to confront and test mortals' convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity, they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons, gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices, resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they fight with sadness.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Celestial__ (__Religion__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Medium","traits":["CG","Medium","Azata","Celestial"],"senses":["Perception +11","darkvision"],"languages":["Celestial","Draconic","Infernal","tongues"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":11,"misc":null}],"perception":11,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["silver rapier","silver virtuoso flute"],"ac":21,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":75,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"cold iron"},{"amount":5,"type":"evil"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Vulnerable to Smoke","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A gancanagh's lungs can't tolerate smoke.

Perpetually ravenous, these aberrations are always seeking their next meals, ever eating but never sated. With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.\n\n\n\nWhere, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers. They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal's attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth—though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter—at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers' noises—studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.\n\n\n\nWhatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the prevalence of settlements that don't tolerate gibbering mouthers' presence.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 20","level":5,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +15","darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":13,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":2,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":21,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":15,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":10,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":120,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"bludgeoning"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Gibbering","action_cost":"None","traits":["auditory","aura","emotion","enchantment","incapacitation","mental","occult"],"description":"Each creature that begins its turn within 60 feet of a gibbering mouther must attempt a DC 19 Will save.

As cowardly as they are ugly, goblin dogs prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone or wounded prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to flee from a fight if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates.\n\n\n\nGoblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven't bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs.\n\n\n\nEven the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This \"goblin pox\" causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don't share the goblin dogs' terrible hygiene—with the notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness.\n\n\n\nHunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won't dare to eat. \"Will it eat?\" is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog's snout. \"Will it die?\" is often a game played after \"Will it eat?\" Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 15","level":1,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +6","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":7,"misc":null}],"perception":6,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":17,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":8,"fort_misc":null,"ref":8,"ref_misc":null,"will":5,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":17,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Buck","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"DC 17","raw_description":"**Buck** [Reaction] DC 17","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Irritating Dander","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A creature that hits the goblin dog with an unarmed attack, tries to Grapple it, or otherwise touches it is exposed to goblin pox.","raw_description":"**Irritating Dander** A creature that hits the goblin dog with an unarmed attack, tries to Grapple it, or otherwise touches it is exposed to goblin pox.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Juke","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Juke** [Reaction] **Requirement** A creature must be mounted on the goblin dog. **Trigger** The rider issues a command to the goblin dog. **Effect** The goblin dog Steps before following the command.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"A creature must be mounted on the goblin dog.","effect":"The rider issues a command to the goblin dog.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":9,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d6+3","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"goblin pox"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Goblin Pox","action_cost":"None","traits":["disease"],"description":"Goblins and goblin dogs are immune to goblin pox. **Saving Throw** DC 17 Fortitude; **Stage 1** __sickened__ 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** sickened 1 and __slowed__ 1 (1 round); **Stage 3** sickened 2 and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).","raw_description":"**Goblin Pox** (__disease__) Goblins and goblin dogs are immune to goblin pox. **Saving Throw** DC 17 Fortitude; **Stage 1** __sickened__ 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** sickened 1 and __slowed__ 1 (1 round); **Stage 3** sickened 2 and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Scratch","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["manipulate"],"description":"The goblin dog vigorously scratches itself, exposing all adjacent creatures to goblin pox.","raw_description":"**Scratch** [Two Actions]  (__manipulate__) The goblin dog vigorously scratches itself, exposing all adjacent creatures to goblin pox.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"summonSpells":[{"spell":"Summon Animal","level":2}],"url":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=236"},{"name":"Gogiteth","source":[{"abbr":"Bestiary","page_start":183,"page_stop":null}],"description":"A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it.

A gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is one, a swarm is sure to follow.\n\n\n\nGogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many legs pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound voluntarily so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd creatures can also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout the caverns where they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of gogiteths sometimes join together in eerie, discordant songs.\n\n\n\nGogiteths' alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin stories.

Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion of the Black—possibly the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien entity; according to this mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the gogiteths crawled into the depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing sun above.\n\n\n\nGogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow and duergars in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently organize hunting parties to eradicate the terrors, even calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies in times when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even an average gogiteth hive can host up to two dozen of the horrors, missions to eradicate them when they become established are dangerous quests indeed.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 30","level":12,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +21","darkvision"],"languages":["Undercommon","(can't speak)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":24,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":17,"misc":"+24 to Track"}],"perception":21,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":25,"fort_misc":null,"ref":22,"ref_misc":null,"will":20,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":250,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"poison"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Skittering Reposition","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":["move"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Skittering Reposition** [Reaction] (__move__) **Trigger** A creature that starts its move outside the gogiteth's reach moves into its reach. **Effect** The gogiteth moves 10 feet.

They make their dens in the shallows of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nA grauladon's stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result of the creature's fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons' exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons' breath, they have earned the nickname \"mud drakes\" from rural folk.\n\n\n\nGrauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates. They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and won't tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 18","level":2,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","N","Large","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +7","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Draconic","can't speak any language"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":5,"misc":null}],"perception":7,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":0,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":17,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":12,"fort_misc":null,"ref":6,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":35,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Reactive Breath","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Reactive Breath** [Reaction] **Trigger** The grauladon takes damage from an adjacent creature. **Effect** The grauladon uses Noxious Breath, including the triggering creature in the area.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"The grauladon takes damage from an adjacent creature.","effect":"The grauladon uses Noxious Breath, including the triggering creature in the area.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":10,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d12+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tail","to_hit":10,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+4","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Body Slam","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Body Slam**   **Requirements** More than one enemy is adjacent to the grauladon. **Effect** The grauladon swings its tail at each adjacent enemy and attempts to Trip each creature adjacent to it.

Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.\n\n\n\nDebate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species. Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind, lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 32","level":12,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Huge","traits":["Uncommon","CE","Huge","Giant","Humanoid","Mutant"],"senses":["Perception +22","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Cyclops","Jotun"],"skills":[{"name":"any one Lore ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["greatclub","hide armor"],"ac":32,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":25,"fort_misc":null,"ref":19,"ref_misc":null,"will":22,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":235,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Catch Rock","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Catch Rock** [Reaction]","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Ferocity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Ferocity** [Reaction] **Trigger** The monster is reduced to 0 HP. **Effect** The monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but its wounded value increases by 1.

They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare cases, the griffon's hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether. These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these offshoots survive their fledgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.\n\n\n\nWild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim's flesh with their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground, they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then fly off with their prize. The exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear of endangering its chicks.\n\n\n\nSkilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great respect and envy.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +11","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":9,"misc":null}],"perception":11,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":21,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":60,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"},{"amount":60,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"beak","to_hit":14,"traits":["deadly 1d10"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"talon","to_hit":14,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"wing","to_hit":14,"traits":["reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+4","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Flying Strafe","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":null,"description":"The griffon Flies up to its fly Speed and makes two talon Strikes at any point during that movement.

Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.\n\n\n\nGrimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these \"pets\" poorly at best.\n\n\n\nThere are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.\n\n\n\nGrimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 20","level":5,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Medium","traits":["CE","Medium","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +12","low-light vision"],"languages":["Aklo","Common"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":12,"misc":null}],"perception":12,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Camouflage","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A grimstalker can __Hide__ in natural environments, even if it doesn't have cover.","raw_description":"**Camouflage** A grimstalker can __Hide__ in natural environments, even if it doesn't have cover.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":22,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":60,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":20,"type":"climb"},{"amount":null,"type":"woodland stride"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":15,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+7","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"grimstalker sap"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":22,"to_hit":14,"misc":"","spell_groups":[{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"earthbind","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"wall of thorns","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"entangle","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"pass without trace","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"tree shape","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":3,"spells":[{"name":"tanglefoot","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Grimstalker Sap","action_cost":"None","traits":["poison"],"description":"**Saving Throw** DC 22 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 2** 1d6 poison damage and __clumsy 1__ (1 round), **Stage 3** 2d6 poison damage and clumsy 2 (1 round)","raw_description":"**Grimstalker Sap** (__poison__) **Saving Throw** DC 22 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage (1 round); **Stage 2** 1d6 poison damage and __clumsy 1__ (1 round), **Stage 3** 2d6 poison damage and clumsy 2 (1 round)","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Woodland Stride","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A grimstalker can always find a path, almost as if foliage parts before it.

They dwell mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers, coastal regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own.\n\n\n\nGrindylows aren't territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.\n\n\n\nGrindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable. This hatred of squids does not extend to other tentacled creatures; grindylows consider octopuses to be the epitome of grace and power.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 14","level":0,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Small","traits":["CE","Small","Aberration","Amphibious"],"senses":["Perception +5","darkvision"],"languages":["Aquan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":5,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":5,"misc":null}],"perception":5,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["spear"],"ac":15,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":6,"fort_misc":null,"ref":7,"ref_misc":null,"will":5,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":14,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"A grindylow gains 1 extra reaction at the start of each of its turns that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity with a tentacle.

Their supernatural physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long, fleshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies.\n\n\n\nGrodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes the creatures difficult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difficulty remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they aren't reliable. They have difficulty following plans or schedules, and they can keep a secret only if they happen to forget it first. For these reasons, grodairs don't always make the best allies.\n\n\n\nGrodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them for consumption at a later time.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Beast__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 20\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 20","level":5,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Medium","traits":["CN","Medium","Amphibious","Beast","Fey","Water"],"senses":["Perception +13","darkvision"],"languages":["Aquan","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":11,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":20,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":15,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":88,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Death Flood","action_cost":"None","traits":["conjuration","primal","water"],"description":"When a grodair dies, its body explodes in a blast of pressurized water that deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within a 15-foot emanation (DC 22 basic Reflex save).

A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.\n\n\n\nGuardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly.

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.\n\n\n\nAlthough gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.\n\n\n\nGugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.\n\n\n\nGugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.\n\n\n\nSome particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +19","darkvision"],"languages":["Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":19,"misc":"+23 to Squeeze"},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":19,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":19,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":175,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

A typical hellcat is 9 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nLeft to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As fiendish creatures, they do not require mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inflicting pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may find themself made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.\n\n\n\nThough they can't speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of their diabolic masters.\n\n\n\nHellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up against foes they're unable to reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies, including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes against their foes.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Beast__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 23\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fiend__ (__Religion__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Large","traits":["LE","Large","Beast","Fiend"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Infernal","can't speak any language","telepathy 100 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":15,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":110,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"fire"},{"amount":5,"type":"physical (except silver)"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"good"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Fade into the Light","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":["divine","illusion"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Fade into the Light [Reaction]** (__divine__, __illusion__) **Trigger** The hellcat begins its turn in bright light; **Effect** The hellcat becomes __invisible__ until its no longer in bright light.

Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.\n\n\n\nHippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.\n\n\n\nHippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.\n\n\n\nHippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.\n\n\n\nSince hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer, elk, and bears.\n\n\n\nHowever, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat— the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +8","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":6,"misc":null}],"perception":8,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":8,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":6,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":32,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Buck","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"DC 17","raw_description":"**__Buck__ [Reaction]** DC 17","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":30,"type":"Land"},{"amount":65,"type":"fly"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"beak","to_hit":9,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d10+3","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"talon","to_hit":9,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6+3","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"wing","to_hit":9,"traits":["reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6+3","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Flying Strafe","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":null,"description":"The hippogriff __Flies__ up to its fly speed and makes two talon Strikes at any point during that movement.

When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator's own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator's intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator's basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters.\n\n\n\nIn most cases, a homunculus doesn't survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator's child or successor and attempting to further its creator's legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature's death, a portion of the dead master's soul \"infects\" the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn't result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these \"awakened\" homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator's class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.\n\n\n\nHomunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator's own blood. It is possible for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is more difficult.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 14","level":0,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Tiny","traits":["N","Tiny","Construct"],"senses":["Perception +3","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","(can't speak any language)","master link"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":5,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":5,"misc":null}],"perception":3,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-1,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":0,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Master Link","action_cost":"None","traits":["arcane","divination","mental"],"description":"A homunculus can't speak, but it is telepathically linked to its creator.

Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 28\n\n","level":7,"rarity":"Rare","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["Rare","NE","Medium","Aberration","Time"],"senses":["Perception +17","greater darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":13,"misc":"+17 to Track"}],"perception":17,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":6,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":6,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":15,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":90,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["controlled","emotion"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"mental"},{"amount":10,"type":"poison"},{"amount":10,"type":"physical"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Otherworldly Mind","action_cost":"None","traits":["mental"],"description":"Whenever a creature targets the hound with a __mental__ effect,\n\nthat creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 25 basic Will save).

Their jagged gray shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.\n\n\n\nWhile one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 31","level":13,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Large","traits":["NE","Large","Aberration","Earth"],"senses":["Perception +24","darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo","Common","Jotun","Terran"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":26,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":24,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":8,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":34,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":25,"ref_misc":null,"will":24,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":265,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":10,"type":"bludgeoning"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":30,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"climb"},{"amount":null,"type":"stone step"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":26,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"3d8+13","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":"2d6","type":"acid"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"legs","to_hit":26,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"3d10+13","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":31,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":6,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"stone tell","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"meld into stone","frequency":"at will","requirement":null},{"name":"shape stone","frequency":"at will","requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Regurgitate Gastrolith","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["acid","evocation","primal"],"description":"The irlgaunt violently regurgitates a melonsized clot of brittle stone supernaturally infused with digestive enzymes.

At first glance, kishi appear to be attractive humans, usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face, that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation, their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments. Kishi are highly varied in their physical features, and their height and weight are as variable as the people whose communities they infiltrate.\n\n\n\nLike most fey, a kishi's motives are inscrutable, though to its victims, the kishi's goal seems simple—to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishi can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. Kishi are the ultimate sociopaths, deriving pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better, for nothing satisfies kishi as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.\n\n\n\nWhen kishi get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true, monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishi have no desire to share their true nature with the entire village, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who, cut off from air, are unable to cry out for help. Kishi consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime—even lapping up any spilled blood and cleaning the murder scene as much as they are able.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 24","level":8,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +14","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":18,"misc":null}],"perception":14,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":18,"ref_misc":null,"will":17,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":138,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"piercing"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":20,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"2d10+9","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":20,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+9","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Arcane Innate Spells","dc":27,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"charm","frequency":"at will","requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Constrict","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"1d10+9 piercing, DC 26 (grabbed by jaws only)","raw_description":"**Constrict**   1d10+9 piercing, DC 26 (grabbed by jaws only)","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Head Spin","action_cost":"Free Action","traits":null,"description":"The kishi switches between showing its attractive human face and its snarling hyena face.

While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs.\n\n\n\nKrooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creatures—fierce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature's blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth.\n\n\n\nWhether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears. This doesn't mean krooths won't kill goblinoids, especially those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only their claws and tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly after such a killing.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 24","level":8,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Amphibious","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +16","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":18,"misc":"+20 in water"},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":17,"misc":"+20 to Track a bleeding creature"}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":26,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":20,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":14,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+4 status to all saves vs. fear"},"hp":150,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"Tail only.","raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Rather, they engage in conversation and try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of those they meet—a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining for goods or favors. They aren't above turning people against each other for their own benefit but generally not to an extent that causes harm.\n\n\n\nIn most cases, a leprechaun doesn't keep a purloined possession for long. The leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun's trick goes too far and results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even death.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Small","traits":["CN","Small","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +11","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Gold Lore ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Thievery ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":11,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":8,"fort_misc":null,"ref":11,"ref_misc":null,"will":10,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":25,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":30,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"club","to_hit":7,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d6+3","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":18,"to_hit":10,"misc":"","spell_groups":[{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"illusory creature","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"illusory object","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"invisibility","frequency":"self only","requirement":null}]},{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"color spray","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"shillelagh","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"ventriloquism","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":2,"spells":[{"name":"dancing lights","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"ghost sound","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"mage hand","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"prestidigitation","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"telekinetic projectile","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Create Object","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["conjuration","manipulate","primal"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Create Object** [Two Actions]  (__conjuration__, __manipulate__, __primal__) **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** The leprechaun produces an item out of their hat, from behind their jacket, from within a hole in a tree stump, or from any other unexpected location.

They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without \"polluting\" them with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day. Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend's chronicles, as their relationship with their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for overlong in a mortal's life, in part because they fear what sort of fiendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out of respect for the mortal's own destiny. A lillend would, all things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down a path to which their heart is not set.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Celestial__ (__Religion__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Large","traits":["CG","Large","Azata","Celestial"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision"],"languages":["Celestial","Draconic","Infernal","speak with animals","speak with plants","tongues"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":12,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["+1 longsword","virtuoso harp"],"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":14,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":145,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold iron"},{"amount":10,"type":"evil"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Free Expression","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A lillend's auditory and sonic effects attempt to counteract any effect that would directly control, manipulate, or prevent them from expressing themself freely, such as silence.

It typically looks like a cartoonish humanoid made of wet oil paint. These two-dimensional beings are unbound from the canvases on which they were originally drawn and can move along any flat surface they touch, including walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They cannot exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. Although they are not incredibly intelligent, living graffiti exhibit a mischievous spitefulness and seeming desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain. \n\n## Variant Living Graffiti\n\n The living graffiti below is but one type of this strange creature. Other living graffiti exist, made from media like chalk, pastels, ink, or tempera, or even more archaic materials like mud, beeswax, or blood. The following are a few examples of the kinds of abilities such a variant living graffiti might have. \n\n\n\n**Blood**: The living graffiti gains the following ability.\n\n**Absorb Blood** Anytime a creature within 5 feet of the living graffiti takes slashing, piercing, or __persistent bleed__ damage, the graffiti gains a number of temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt to the adjacent creature. \n\n\n\n**Chalk**: The living graffiti gains the following ability. \n\n**Cone of Chalk** [Two Actions] The living graffiti expels a 15-foot cone of chalk. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The living graffiti can't use Cone of Chalk again for 1d4 rounds. \n\n\n\n**Ink**: The living graffiti's HP increases to 60 and its splatter Strike deals 2d6 damage (in addition to blinding for 1 round), but it gains the following weakness.\n\n**Water Weakness** When the living graffiti is doused with water or starts its turn in water (either through a spell or some other effect, such as pouring a bucket of water over it), it takes 2d6 damage.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Medium","traits":["CN","Medium","Construct"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":5,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":11,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":2,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":8,"fort_misc":null,"ref":11,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":50,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["bleed","death effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","necromancy","nonlethal","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Backdrop","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When a creature attempts to Strike a living graffiti and critically misses, the attacker hits the surface (a wall, canvas, or so on) behind the living graffiti.

They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel.

They trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in the flames of their carefully curated fires, there is little that brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant creatures cooking to a crisp.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 34","level":15,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Fey","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +27","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Elven","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":25,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":27,"misc":null}],"perception":27,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":8,"int_mod":4,"wis_mod":6,"cha_mod":8},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":37,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":29,"fort_misc":null,"ref":25,"ref_misc":null,"will":27,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":280,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"physical (except slashing)"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":15,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Fascination of Flame","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","enchantment","mental","primal"],"description":"30 feet.

To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical carny's Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following.\n\n\n\n**Bounce Back** [Reaction] **Requirement** The mechanical carny takes damage from a melee attack; **Effect** The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro, making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against the creature that triggered this reaction.\n\n\n\n**Spring-Loaded Jump**  (__move__) The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet (or a distance equal to the height of the carny's jump, if fewer) of where it started, taking no falling damage.\n\n\n\n**Water Cannon**  (__water__) The mechanical carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Construct","Mindless"],"senses":["Perception +6","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","(can speak pre-recorded phrases only)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":6,"misc":null}],"perception":6,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":0,"int_mod":-5,"wis_mod":0,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":17,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":8,"fort_misc":null,"ref":11,"ref_misc":null,"will":4,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":33,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["bleed","death effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"resistances":[{"amount":3,"type":"physical (except adamantine)"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":6,"type":"electricity"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Haywire","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A severely damaged mechanical carny has a chance of malfunctioning.

Rusalkas are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world in peace.\n\n\n\nWhen a nereid learns of a rusalka's increased activity, it often seeks out the rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from humanoids who can't be bothered to note the difference between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Medium","traits":["CN","Medium","Aquatic","Fey","Water"],"senses":["Perception +20","low-light vision"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":12,"misc":"+18 to Swim"},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":20,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":0,"dex_mod":7,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":7},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":22,"ref_misc":null,"will":18,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":175,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["poison"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold iron"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Watery Transparency","action_cost":"None","traits":["primal","transmutation","water"],"description":"When underwater, the nereid's body is __invisible__.

Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and flesh of the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their victims' subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim.\n\n\n\nNiliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many who investigate the nature of the nilith's bond are driven to madness before getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for thousands of years.\n\n\n\nThankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to taste the horrors they bring to others.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +19","darkvision"],"languages":["Aklo","Common","telepathy 30 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":19,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":32,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":20,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":150,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"mental"},{"amount":5,"type":"physical (except silver)"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":23,"traits":["agile","finesse","magical"],"damage":{"formula":"2d10+9","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"fangs","to_hit":23,"traits":["finesse","magical"],"damage":{"formula":"2d12+9","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Occult Innate Spells","dc":29,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":5,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"hallucination","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"mind probe","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"blink","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"confusion","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"crushing despair","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"dream message","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"invisibility","frequency":"at will, self only","requirement":null},{"name":"nightmare","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"mind reading","frequency":"at will","requirement":null}]},{"level":0,"heightened_level":5,"spells":[{"name":"mage hand","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"message","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"read aura","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"shield","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Mind Crush","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["enchantment","mental","occult"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Mind Crush**   (__enchantment__, __mental__, __occult__) **Requirements** The nilith has a creature grabbed. **Effect** The nilith reaches into the mind of the grabbed creature and implants disjointed images of the victim's worst fears and nightmares.

Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.\n\n\n\nNixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.\n\n\n\nNixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 15","level":1,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Small","traits":["N","Small","Aquatic","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +6","low-light vision"],"languages":["Aquan","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":5,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":6,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":0,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Wild Empathy","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The nixie can use __Diplomacy__ to __Make an Impression__ on and make very simple Requests of __aquatic__ or __amphibious__ animals.","raw_description":"**Wild Empathy** The nixie can use __Diplomacy__ to __Make an Impression__ on and make very simple Requests of __aquatic__ or __amphibious__ animals.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":16,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":6,"fort_misc":null,"ref":10,"ref_misc":null,"will":6,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":25,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":3,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":7,"traits":["agile","finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":17,"to_hit":9,"misc":"","spell_groups":[{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"water breathing","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":1,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"charm","frequency":"×3","requirement":null},{"name":"hydraulic push","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Grant Desire","action_cost":"Three Actions","traits":["divination","primal"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Grant Desire** [Three Actions]  (__divination__, __primal__) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The nixie can duplicate any 1st-level spell or produce any effect with a power level in line with a 1st-level spell, but only in response to the request or desire of a non-fey creature.

Indeed, they spend long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims consider familiar, such as front doors and the floors around beds. If someone else gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.\n\n\n\nIn combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to envy on the part of the nuglubs, who find it difficult to fit armor on their twisted bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.\n\n\n\nNuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Small","traits":["CE","Small","Fey","Gremlin"],"senses":["Perception +5","darkvision"],"languages":["Undercommon"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":5,"misc":"+7 traps"},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":5,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":-1,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":10,"ref_misc":null,"will":5,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":34,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":2,"type":"cold iron"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Kneecapper","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Kneecapper [Reaction]** **Trigger** A Medium creature within the nuglub's reach leaves a square during its __move__ action; **Effect** The nuglub lashes out at the triggering creature's knees and tries to knock them __prone__.

They are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting disease—a terrible and aptly named affliction that causes the victim's blood to seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy.\n\n\n\nOfalths' domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for its rubbery flesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time. They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks, forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the ofalth feeds.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +18","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":19,"misc":"+23 in trash and rubbish"}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Refuse Pile","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When it's not in danger, an ofalth can spend 1 minute settling into a 10-foot pile that looks like a heap of garbage.

According to the legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the flrst victim of the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.\n\n\n\nMost owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which are hatched from eggs. An owlbear's territory usually extends to around 5 miles from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested bones these monsters leave behind.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +13","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":10,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":21,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":7,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":70,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"talon","to_hit":14,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"1d10+6","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"beak","to_hit":14,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d12+6","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Bloodcurdling Screech","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["auditory","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"The owlbear unleashes a loud screech that terrifies its prey.

They venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.\n\n\n\nPeludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons.

Its limbs are distributed so evenly across its body that it is all but impossible to tell which way the creature is oriented at any given time. Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though, as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion of their minds, as the quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.\n\n\n\nQuelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher's suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 34","level":15,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +29","tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aklo","(can't speak any language)","telepathy 100 feet"],"skills":[{"name":"Deception ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":27,"misc":null}],"perception":29,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":5,"wis_mod":6,"cha_mod":8},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":36,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":27,"fort_misc":null,"ref":26,"ref_misc":null,"will":31,"will_misc":"+33 vs. emotion","misc":null},"hp":305,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":15,"type":"mental"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":6,"type":"<a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"Spells.aspx?ID=\"><i>air walk</i></a>"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":30,"traits":["agile","magical","reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"3d8+12","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Occult Innate Spells","dc":39,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":7,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"crushing despair","frequency":"x3","requirement":null}]},{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"fear","frequency":"at will","requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"hideous laughter","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":-1,"heightened_level":4,"spells":[{"name":"air walk","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Emotional Focus","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The quelaunt can cast the following cleric domain spells as 8th-level occult innate spells at will without spending Focus Points: __blind ambition__, __captivating adoration__, and __delusional pride__.","raw_description":"**Emotional Focus** The quelaunt can cast the following cleric domain spells as 8th-level occult innate spells at will without spending Focus Points: __blind ambition__, __captivating adoration__, and __delusional pride__.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Emotional Frenzy","action_cost":"Three Actions","traits":null,"description":"The quelaunt casts up to three spells chosen from its at-will innate spells and its emotional focus spells.","raw_description":"**Emotional Frenzy** [Three Actions]  The quelaunt casts up to three spells chosen from its at-will innate spells and its emotional focus spells.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Feed on Emotion","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["attack","emotion","incapacitation","mental"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Feed on Emotion**   (__attack__, __emotion__, __incapacitation__, __mental__) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The quelaunt feeds on the emotional unrest of a single creature within 30 feet that's under a harmful emotion effect.

Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Large","traits":["NE","Large","Aberration","Aquatic"],"senses":["Perception +22","low-light vision"],"languages":["Aquan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":23,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":6,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":23,"ref_misc":null,"will":18,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":195,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":"Tentacle only.","raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting— especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is.

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.\n\n\n\nWhile reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they've been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.\n\n\n\nOnce a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.\n\n\n\nDespite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 15","level":1,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Small","traits":["CN","Small","Aberration","Aquatic"],"senses":["Perception +8","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":4,"misc":"+8 to Swim"}],"perception":8,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":20,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":7,"fort_misc":null,"ref":9,"ref_misc":null,"will":4,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":17,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Death Frenzy","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Death Frenzy** [Reaction] **Trigger** The reefclaw is reduced to 0 Hit Points. **Effect** The reefclaw makes a claw Strike before dying.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"The reefclaw is reduced to 0 Hit Points.","effect":"The reefclaw makes a claw Strike before dying.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":5,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":9,"traits":["finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6+1","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"reefclaw venom and Grab"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Constrict","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"1d6 bludgeoning, DC 17","raw_description":"**__Constrict__**   1d6 bludgeoning, DC 17","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Reefclaw Venom","action_cost":"None","traits":["poison"],"description":"**Saving Throw** DC 17 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage and __enfeebled 1__ (1 round), **Stage 2** 1d6 poison damage and __enfeebled 2__ (1 round).","raw_description":"**Reefclaw Venom** (__poison__) **Saving Throw** DC 17 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 4 rounds; **Stage 1** 1d6 poison damage and __enfeebled 1__ (1 round), **Stage 2** 1d6 poison damage and __enfeebled 2__ (1 round).","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"summonSpells":[{"spell":"Summon Entity","level":5}],"url":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=350"},{"name":"Revenant","source":[{"abbr":"Bestiary 2","page_start":227,"page_stop":null}],"description":"Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers.

While their beaks are hooked to rip flesh from bone, their hunting strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds' meals. Rocs, for the most part, don't mind these creatures, which sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc's food.\n\n\n\nRocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.\n\n\n\nParticularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 26","level":9,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Gargantuan","traits":["N","Gargantuan","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +18","low-light vision"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":21,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":27,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":20,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":180,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Wing Rebuff","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Wing Rebuff** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature moves from beyond the reach of the roc's wing to within the reach of the roc's wing. **Effect** The roc makes a wing Strike against the triggering creature.

Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper's appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, the ropers' appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers' wits and patience.

However, it is the rust monster's feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts of battle-hardened warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can reduce an adventurer's most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust.\n\n\n\nRust monsters aren't inherently aggressive creatures, but they're voracious oxidivores, meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae.

Notorious for their hedonism, these fey believe there's no greater beauty than can be found in song, drink, indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs and natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires and free themselves from society's rules. This usually involves enticing mortals to join raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion rejects a satyr's advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing a conversation and goes off to find more amenable revelers.\n\n\n\nThe lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends. Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and usually end up being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than being left in mortals' care. Satyrs are always male.\n\n\n\nThe untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish intruders who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk drawing a satyr's ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and attempts to dispatch them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of forest animals to attack.\n\n\n\nOther fey, particularly good fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing cousins. They're rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most find them insufferable and advise any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs' glades.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CN","size":"Medium","traits":["CN","Medium","Fey"],"senses":["Perception +10","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Performance ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":10,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":1,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Sylvan Wine","action_cost":"None","traits":["enchantment","mental","primal"],"description":"A satyr's wineskin magically enchants any alcohol inside.

This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny sliver of the creator's soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion of the creator's soul never returns.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 19","level":4,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Construct"],"senses":["Perception +11","darkvision"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":12,"misc":null}],"perception":11,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":-2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":13,"fort_misc":null,"ref":8,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":60,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["bleed","death effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"],"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"physical (except slashing)"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"fire"}],"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Scarecrow's Leer","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental","occult","visual"],"description":"40 feet.

The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an extra dimension of flavor to the meal.\n\n\n\nScythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that they don't need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.\n\n\n\nScythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than being hacked to pieces.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Huge","traits":["CE","Huge","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +14","lifesense 30 feet","low-light vision"],"languages":["Aklo","Arboreal","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":12,"misc":"+14 in forests"}],"perception":14,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":8,"ref_misc":null,"will":9,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":105,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"bludgeoning"},{"amount":5,"type":"piercing"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Axe Vulnerability","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A scythe tree takes 5 additional damage from __axes__.","raw_description":"**Axe Vulnerability** A scythe tree takes 5 additional damage from __axes__.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Ripping Disarm","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Ripping Disarm [Reaction]** **Trigger** A creature rolls a critical failure on a melee weapon Strike against the scythe tree; **Effect** The scythe tree attempts to __Disarm__ the creature.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"A creature rolls a critical failure on a melee weapon Strike against the scythe tree","effect":"The scythe tree attempts to __Disarm__ the creature.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":15,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"scythe branch","to_hit":18,"traits":["backswing","deadly d10","reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d10+9","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Dead Tree","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["concentrate"],"description":"Until the scythe tree acts, it appears to be a dead tree.

These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist, keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in high, isolated mountain valleys.\n\n\n\nStanding 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter, shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors who show the giants the respect and deference they feel they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants worship __Zon-Kuthon__, and most of these Kuthites are so firmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize them.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.\n\n\n\nShamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for—or perhaps to summon—intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected (and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.\n\n\n\nOther types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and in  ict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +12","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","Elven","Sylvan","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":12,"misc":"+18 in forests or swamps"}],"perception":12,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Mound","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When it's not in danger, the shambler spends 1 minute settling into a pile that looks like a lump of loose vegetation.

The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn't long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn's veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.\n\n## Sinspawn Sins\n\n When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envoy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn's sin is determined by the runewell that spawned it or by its creator's preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.\n\n## Envyspawn\n\n An envyspawn has Deception +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be shorter and thinner than other sinspawn.\n\n**Melee**  halberd +10 (__reach 10 feet__, __versatile S__), **Damage** 1d10+4 piercing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against an envyspawn's sinful bite are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Gluttonyspawn\n\n A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese, but hardy and strong.\n\n**Melee**  scythe +10 (__deadly d10__, __trip__), **Damage** 1d10+4 slashing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn's sinful bite are drained 1. \n\n## Greedspawn\n\n A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest of sinspawn, often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins.\n\n**Melee**  glaive +10 (__deadly d8__, __forceful__, __reach 10 feet__), **Damage** 1d8+4 slashing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn's sinful bite are clumsy 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Lustspawn\n\n A lustspawn has Diplomacy +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have attractive bodies, but hideous faces.\n\n**Melee**  guisarme +10 (__reach 10 feet__, __trip__), **Damage** 1d10+4 slashing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn's sinful bite are stupefied 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Pridespawn\n\n A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out fine clothes or jewelry to wear, taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal.\n\n**Melee**  maul +10 (__shove__), **Damage** 1d12+4 bludgeoning\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn's sinful bite are clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. \n\n## Slothspawn\n\n A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess skin drape the slothspawn's hunched frame.\n\n**Melee**  longspear +10 (__reach 10 feet__), **Damage** 1d8+4 piercing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn's sinful bite take a -10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute. \n\n## Wrathspawn\n\n The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur.

A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.\n\n\n\nSkrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +16","motionsense 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":16,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Motionsense","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A flying skrik nettle can detect the movement of nearby creatures and objects from the tiny gusts of wind created by their movements.

Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth— to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.\n\n\n\nGiant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges, or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don't have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like __kobolds__ or __xulgaths__.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 24","level":8,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +14","no hearing","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":19,"misc":null}],"perception":14,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":-1,"con_mod":7,"int_mod":-5,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":21,"fort_misc":null,"ref":11,"ref_misc":null,"will":14,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":165,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"acid"}],"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"salt"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"},{"amount":15,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"radula","to_hit":21,"traits":["reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d10+10","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"mucus"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"foot","to_hit":21,"traits":["reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+10","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"mucus"}]}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"disgorged mucus","to_hit":17,"traits":["brutal","range increment 50 feet","splash"],"damage":{"formula":"3d6","type":"acid damage"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"mucus and 1d6 acid splash damage"}]}],"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Malleable","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The giant slug can fit through tight spaces as if it were a Large creature.

It has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks. With the slurk's natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast's formidable ivory tusks.\n\n\n\nSlurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk's back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster's other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk's ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals.\n\n\n\nSlurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take advantage of the slurk's ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the walls of a cavern.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Animal"],"senses":["Perception +6","darkvision"],"languages":["Draconic","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":6,"misc":"+8 to Escape"},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":5,"misc":null}],"perception":6,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":0,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":17,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":10,"fort_misc":"+12 vs. Grapple or Shove","ref":6,"ref_misc":null,"will":4,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":35,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":30,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tusks","to_hit":11,"traits":["deadly 1d10"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"slime squirt","to_hit":9,"traits":["range increment 30 feet"],"damage":null,"plus_damage":null}],"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Belly Grease","action_cost":"Three Actions","traits":null,"description":"The slurk extrudes a slippery grease from its ventral glands to coat the floor under it and in a 5-foot emanation, turning the affected area into uneven ground for 10 minutes, after which it dries to a putrid crust.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred\n\n\n\nSoulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.\n\n\n\nThe soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther a  eld on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"Any","size":"Tiny","traits":["Any","Tiny","Construct","Soulbound"],"senses":["Perception +8","darkvision"],"languages":["one spoken by its creator (typically Common)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":4,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":8,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-2,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Personality Fragments","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A soulbound doll shares fragments of its donor soul's personality, though none of that creature's memories.

Often quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it appear to be even larger than it actually is. A swimming spinosaurus can also use the sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to make a crushing wave.\n\n\n\nThe spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones seated in the surrounding stands.\n\n\n\nThe spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus's potential. More so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to fleshwarping procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance the creatures' viability as effective guardians.\n\n\n\nA spinosaurus can measure up to 60 feet in length and weighs 25,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Gargantuan","traits":["N","Gargantuan","Animal","Dinosaur"],"senses":["Perception +21","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":"+25 to Swim"}],"perception":21,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Deep Breath","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A spinosaurus can hold its breath for 2 hours.","raw_description":"**Deep Breath** A spinosaurus can hold its breath for 2 hours.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":23,"fort_misc":null,"ref":21,"ref_misc":null,"will":19,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":200,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":30,"type":"swim"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"bite","to_hit":23,"traits":["deadly d12","reach 20 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d12+14","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":23,"traits":["agile","reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d8+14","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Rip and Tear","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Rip and Tear**   **Requirements **The spinosaurus has a creature __grabbed__ in its jaws; **Effect **The spinosaurus reaches up and slashes with its claws at the creature it has grabbed, dealing 4d8 slashing damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save) and 1d6 __persistent bleed damage__.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":"The spinosaurus has a creature __grabbed__ in its jaws","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Staggering Sail","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":["incapacitation"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Staggering Sail** [Two Actions]  (__incapacitation__) **Requirements **The spinosaurus is swimming on the surface of water; **Effect **With a powerful lunge to the side, the spinosaurus uses its sail to slap the surface of the water, creating a crushing wave of water that deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage in a 30.foot cone.

These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there.\n\n\n\nDespite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.

This strange configuration protects this herbivore from predators, as the stegosaurus can hunker down to interpose its dorsal plates between an attacker and its thick body. A stegosaurus defends itself by swinging its spiked tail at larger foes and trampling smaller opponents underfoot.\n\n\n\nThe stegosaurus often inhabits grasslands, where nutritious vegetation is plentiful and only its dorsal plates rise above waving fields of tall grass. The stegosaurus is among the most curious of dinosaurs, and hunters often find it easy to bait them with shiny trinkets or strange noises. A stegosaurus is about 30 feet long, 16 feet high at the top of its highest dorsal plate, and weighs between 2 and 3 tons.\n\n\n\nThe stegosaurus is generally more even-tempered and even gentle, despite its size, than the ankylosaurus. This combination makes it even more popular as a trained pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the dinosaur—an angry or annoyed stegosaurus can lash out with its tail with little warning. Often, it's wiser to train smaller variants, such as the kentrosaurus. Regardless, their dorsal plates make this dinosaur a poor choice as a mount.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Animal__ (__Nature__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Huge","traits":["N","Huge","Animal","Dinosaur"],"senses":["Perception +15","low-light vision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":20,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":23,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":13,"ref_misc":null,"will":13,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":125,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Dorsal Deflection","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Dorsal Deflection** [Reaction] **Trigger** The stegosaurus is targeted with a melee attack. **Effect** The stegosaurus leans its dorsal plates into the attack, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggering attack.

When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites.\n\n\n\nThe more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious.

Taiga giants are happiest when they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.\n\n\n\nTaiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people. Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close.\n\n\n\nMost taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly than insulting their ancestors.

Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of intelligence. They can speak __Draconic__ (with a thick, hissing accent), but their ability to reason is limited and they can't use magic. They do possess a level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don't expect to find a tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.\n\n\n\nSome tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though it's a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller size), guides (when they're familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon's direct attention).\n\n\n\nTatzlwyrms don't work with __kobolds__, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.\n\n\n\nTatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.\n\n\n\nWhen confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face. Since this breath attack doesn't have much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes first and bring them close to their mouth.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 16","level":2,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Medium","traits":["N","Medium","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +8","darkvision"],"languages":["Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Crafting ","bonus":4,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":6,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":7,"misc":null}],"perception":8,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-3,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Natural Camouflage","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A tatzlwyrm's green, gray, and brown scales provide it natural camouflage.

Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices finish the meal, while swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature. When collected, neutralized, and refined, the digestive fluids of a tendriculos form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos's acid resistance.\n\n\n\nA tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the __Sylvan__ language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different tongue, such as __Aklo__, __Draconic__, or even __Necril__. Regardless, tendriculoses have little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive when handed over.\n\n\n\nWhen it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach. Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived digestion and indicate that a tendriculos's hunting grounds lie nearby.\n\n\n\nTendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast forth millions of spores.

Immune to poison and able to traverse sticky webs thanks to the thick slime that covers their bodies, tixitogs steal food cocooned in spider lairs and prey on spiders themselves, but they are careful never to kill so many that their food supply runs out. Their favorite meal, however, is the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.\n\n\n\nThese strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue.\n\n\n\nA tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog's lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 20","level":3,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["Uncommon","NE","Medium","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision","web sense (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aklo","Common"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Spider Lore ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":3,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":-1},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Web Sense","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The tixitog can detect the vibrations of creatures touching a web that the tixitog is also touching.","raw_description":"**Web Sense** The tixitog can detect the vibrations of creatures touching a web that the tixitog is also touching.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":10,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":40,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["poison"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"},{"amount":25,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":10,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d12+5","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"tongue","to_hit":12,"traits":["reach 20 feet"],"damage":null,"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"leg","to_hit":10,"traits":["agile"],"damage":{"formula":"1d10+5","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Swallow Whole","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"Small, 1d12+3 bludgeoning, Rupture 10","raw_description":"**Swallow Whole**   Small, 1d12+3 bludgeoning, Rupture 10","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Tongue Pull","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When a tixitog hits a Small or smaller creature with its tongue Strike, the target is pulled into the tixitog's mouth.

Short-tempered and obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a fight unless they are hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to fight to the death for no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs' protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.\n\n\n\nTriceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as ceratopids, but many others exist.

A twigjack's body is made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair, tops a twigjack's head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living in the undergrowth.\n\n\n\nWhile truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures, especially __fey__, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly arrive to fight, even if they were not invited.\n\n\n\nLess seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for __leshys__, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful __dryad__, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some __spriggans__, __quicklings__, and __redcaps__ harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes.\n\n\n\nWhile twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the __First World__, it's somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC 18\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Tiny","traits":["CE","Tiny","Fey","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision"],"languages":["Common","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":11,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":11,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":2,"dex_mod":4,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":0,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":19,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":11,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":50,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"fire"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"claw","to_hit":11,"traits":["agile","finesse"],"damage":{"formula":"1d10+4","type":"slashing"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"splinter","to_hit":11,"traits":["deadly 1d6","range increment 30 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6+4","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null}],"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Bramble Jump","action_cost":"Three Actions","traits":["conjuration","plant","primal","teleportation"],"description":null,"raw_description":"**Bramble Jump** [Three Actions]  (__conjuration__, __plant__, __primal__, __teleportation__) **Requirements** The twigjack is in undergrowth; **Effect** The twigjack scrambles into the undergrowth and instantly teleports to a square of undergrowth within 60 feet.

Thundering beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey—such as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.\n\n\n\nTyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful hind legs that allow them to run quickly, and their thick tails provide them with exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim's flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat.\n\n\n\nSome tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers.

Indeed, a de-horned unicorn is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.\n\n\n\nUnicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness. Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers' tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit.

While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like __will-o'-wisps__, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.\n\n\n\nAlthough somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics—such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","traits":["NE","Medium","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision","sense blood (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aklo"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":-5,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Misty Form","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"A vampiric mist's body is composed of a semisolid red mist similar in consistency to thick foam.

When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.\n\n\n\nSince a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.\n\n\n\nThe area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt fresh meat.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 31","level":13,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["N","Large","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +22","low-light vision","tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":null,"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":27,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":24,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":7,"int_mod":-4,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":-3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":33,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":26,"fort_misc":null,"ref":24,"ref_misc":null,"will":22,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":270,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":15,"type":"poison"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Cold Vulnerability","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"When exposed to a __cold__ effect, the viper vine is overwhelmed by lethargy, becoming __slowed 1__ for 1d4 rounds.","raw_description":"**Cold Vulnerability** When exposed to a __cold__ effect, the viper vine is overwhelmed by lethargy, becoming __slowed 1__ for 1d4 rounds.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":20,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":27,"traits":["reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"3d6+11","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":"3d6","type":"poison"}]},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"vine","to_hit":27,"traits":["agile","reach 15 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"3d10+11","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Grab"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Captivating Pollen","action_cost":"One Action","traits":["enchantment","incapacitation","mental","poison"],"description":"The viper vine releases a 60-foot emanation of invisible pollen that stays in the air for 5 rounds unless dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind.

Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth's body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.\n\n\n\nSome speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth's creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune's close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas's many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth's description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Plant__ (__Nature__)**: DC 34","level":15,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Huge","traits":["NE","Huge","Plant"],"senses":["Perception +25","darkvision","tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aklo","Sylvan","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":28,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":30,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":27,"misc":null}],"perception":25,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":8,"dex_mod":6,"con_mod":6,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":37,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":27,"fort_misc":null,"ref":27,"ref_misc":null,"will":24,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":335,"hp_misc":"blood leech","immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":20,"type":"cold"},{"amount":15,"type":"slashing"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":25,"type":"Land"},{"amount":25,"type":"burrow"},{"amount":25,"type":"climb"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"pummel","to_hit":29,"traits":["fatal d12","reach 15 feet","sweep"],"damage":{"formula":"4d12+10","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":null,"type":"Improved Grab"}]}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"boulder","to_hit":27,"traits":["fatal d12","range increment 60 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"4d10+10","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"spell_lists":null,"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Blood Leech","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Blood Leech** [Reaction]  **Trigger** The wemmuth deals damage to a creature with Constrict. **Effect** The wemmuth heals a number of Hit Points equal to half the total damage dealt by Constrict.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":"The wemmuth deals damage to a creature with Constrict.","effect":"The wemmuth heals a number of Hit Points equal to half the total damage dealt by Constrict.","requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Constrict","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"2d12+10, DC 37","raw_description":"**Constrict**   2d12+10, DC 37","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Engulf","action_cost":"Two Actions","traits":null,"description":"DC 37, 4d8 bludgeoning, Escape DC 35, Rupture 36","raw_description":"**Engulf** [Two Actions]  DC 37, 4d8 bludgeoning, Escape DC 35, Rupture 36","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null},{"name":"Thorny Mass","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Whenever a creature within 10 feet attempts a melee attack against a wemmuth or uses Acrobatics to Tumble Through its space, that creature takes 1d12+10 piercing damage.","raw_description":"**Thorny Mass** Whenever a creature within 10 feet attempts a melee attack against a wemmuth or uses Acrobatics to Tumble Through its space, that creature takes 1d12+10 piercing damage.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"summonSpells":[{"spell":"Summon Plant or Fungus","level":10}],"url":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=408"},{"name":"Will-o'-Wisp","source":[{"abbr":"Bestiary","page_start":333,"page_stop":null}],"description":"Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o'-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.\n\n\n\nBeneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.\n\n\n\nWill-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster.

Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense humanoid settlements.\n\n\n\nWood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans.\n\n\n\nAn average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Humanoid__ (__Society__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Large","traits":["CG","Large","Giant","Humanoid"],"senses":["Perception +15","low-light vision"],"languages":["Common","Jotun","Sylvan","speak with animals"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Forest Lore ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":13,"misc":"+15 in forests"},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":13,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":5,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":["+1 composite longbow  (20 arrows)","hide armor","shortsword"],"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":17,"fort_misc":null,"ref":14,"ref_misc":null,"will":13,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":120,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":null,"type":">"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Catch Rock","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**__Catch Rock__** [Reaction]","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"speed":[{"amount":35,"type":"Land"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"shortsword","to_hit":17,"traits":["agile","reach 10 feet","versatile S"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+11","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"fist","to_hit":17,"traits":["agile","reach 10 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d6+11","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"ranged":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"composite longbow","to_hit":18,"traits":["deadly d10","range increment 100 feet","reload 0","volley 30 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"1d8+8","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":null},{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"rock","to_hit":17,"traits":["brutal","range increment 120 feet"],"damage":{"formula":"2d6+11","type":"bludgeoning"},"plus_damage":null}],"spell_lists":[{"name":"Primal Innate Spells","dc":23,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":4,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"speak with plants","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":3,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"earthbind","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":2,"heightened_level":null,"spells":[{"name":"entangle","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"tree shape","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]},{"level":-1,"heightened_level":2,"spells":[{"name":"pass without trace","frequency":null,"requirement":null},{"name":"speak with animals","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Piercing Shot","action_cost":"One Action","traits":null,"description":"The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it glances off the first target to strike another target behind the first one.

While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem.

Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or __splash__ weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5.

As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern's resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.\n\n\n\nConversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern's pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Large","traits":["NE","Large","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +13","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":12,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":24,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":13,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":95,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Attack of Opportunity","action_cost":"Reaction","traits":null,"description":null,"raw_description":"**Attack of Opportunity** [Reaction] **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. **Effect** You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.\n\n\n\nYeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack __wargs__, __wolves__, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.\n\n\n\nEvil rangers, bestial __demons__, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to turn against those who fail to advance the patrons' wicked aims. The cult of __Lamashtu__, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Beast__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 18\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fiend__ (__Religion__)**: DC 18","level":3,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Medium","traits":["CE","Medium","Beast","Fiend"],"senses":["Perception +9","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Abyssal","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":8,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":9,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":8,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":4,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":2,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":1},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":18,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":9,"fort_misc":null,"ref":12,"ref_misc":null,"will":12,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":55,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":null,"weaknesses":[{"amount":5,"type":"silver"}],"automatic_abilities":null,"speed":[{"amount":40,"type":"Land"},{"amount":6,"type":"<a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"Spells.aspx?ID=\"><i>air walk</i></a>"}],"melee":[{"action_cost":"One Action","name":"jaws","to_hit":11,"traits":null,"damage":{"formula":"1d8+6","type":"piercing"},"plus_damage":[{"formula":"1d6","type":"evil"},{"formula":null,"type":"Knockdown"},{"formula":null,"type":"sinister bite"}]}],"ranged":null,"spell_lists":[{"name":"Divine Innate Spells","dc":20,"to_hit":null,"misc":null,"spell_groups":[{"level":-1,"heightened_level":4,"spells":[{"name":"air walk","frequency":null,"requirement":null}]}]}],"ritual_lists":null,"proactive_abilities":[{"name":"Bay","action_cost":"Three Actions","traits":["auditory","concentrate","divine","enchantment","fear","mental"],"description":"The yeth hound emits an unearthly howl audible up to 300 feet away.

Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.\n\n\n\nBlack dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They're immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.\n\n\n\nBlack dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.\n\n\n\nNot all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.\n\n\n\nBlue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.\n\n\n\nThe ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 26","level":9,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Large","traits":["LE","Large","Dragon","Electricity"],"senses":["Perception +18","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":16,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Sound Imitation","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The dragon can mimic any sound it has heard.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.\n\n\n\nThese carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.\n\n\n\nThough they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.\n\n\n\nMost brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 23","level":7,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CG","size":"Large","traits":["CG","Large","Dragon","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +15","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Gnomish","Halfling","Sylvan","speak with animals"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":2},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":25,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":15,"ref_misc":null,"will":14,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":125,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 23","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 23 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.\n\n\n\nDepending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.\n\n\n\nAlthough brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 26\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 26","level":8,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"LN","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","LN","Large","Amphibious","Dragon","Elemental","Water"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":27,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":18,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":16,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":142,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["acid","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 24","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 24 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.\n\n\n\nBronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.\n\n\n\nWhile all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 26","level":9,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Large","traits":["LG","Large","Amphibious","Dragon","Water"],"senses":["Perception +18","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic","Dwarven","Elven","speak with animals"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":16,"misc":null}],"perception":18,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":3,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":28,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":19,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":19,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":170,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["electricity","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 26","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 26 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.\n\n\n\nA cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.\n\n\n\nCloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 29\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 29","level":10,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","N","Large","Air","Dragon","Elemental"],"senses":["Perception +22","darkvision","mist vision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Auran","Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":16,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Mist Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Fog and mist don't impair a cloud dragon's vision; they ignore the __concealed__ condition from fog and mist.","raw_description":"**Mist Vision** Fog and mist don't impair a cloud dragon's vision; they ignore the __concealed__ condition from fog and mist.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":21,"fort_misc":null,"ref":18,"ref_misc":null,"will":20,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":175,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["electricity","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 26","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 26 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.\n\n\n\nCopper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.\n\n\n\nA copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles.

Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.\n\n\n\nCrystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.\n\n\n\nAlthough crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 25\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Elemental__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC 25","level":7,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"NG","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","NG","Large","Dragon","Earth","Elemental"],"senses":["Perception +15","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Terran"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":15,"misc":null}],"perception":15,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":27,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":14,"ref_misc":null,"will":15,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":105,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"sonic"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 25","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 25 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.\n\n\n\nWhen another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.\n\nA gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.\n\nGold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 28","level":11,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Large","traits":["LG","Large","Dragon","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +21","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Elven","Sylvan"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":23,"misc":null},{"name":"Medicine ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":18,"misc":null}],"perception":21,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":32,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":22,"will_misc":null,"misc":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic"},"hp":230,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 27","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 27 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.\n\n\n\nThough more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.\n\n\n\nGreen dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.\n\n\n\nTheir hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 24","level":8,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LE","size":"Large","traits":["LE","Large","Amphibious","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +16","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":13,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Occultism ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":15,"misc":null}],"perception":16,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":5,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":28,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":16,"ref_misc":null,"will":17,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":135,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["paralyzed","poison","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 24","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 24 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.\n\n\n\nRed dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.\n\n\n\nDriven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.\n\n\n\nAs legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Dragon","Fire"],"senses":["Perception +20","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","smoke vision"],"languages":["Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":15,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":17,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":19,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":21,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":17,"misc":null}],"perception":20,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":1,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":1,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Smoke Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Smoke doesn't impair a red dragon's vision; it ignores the concealed condition from smoke.","raw_description":"**Smoke Vision** Smoke doesn't impair a red dragon's vision; it ignores the concealed condition from smoke.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":30,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":21,"fort_misc":null,"ref":18,"ref_misc":null,"will":19,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":210,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"cold"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 27","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 27 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.\n\n\n\nSilver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.\n\n\n\nSilver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.\n\n\n\nMany silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 27","level":10,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"LG","size":"Large","traits":["LG","Large","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +20","darkvision","fog vision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Aquan","Common","Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":14,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Diplomacy ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Medicine ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Religion ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Society ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":20,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":2,"wis_mod":4,"cha_mod":4},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Fog Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"The silver dragon ignores the concealed condition from fog and clouds.","raw_description":"**Fog Vision** The silver dragon ignores the concealed condition from fog and clouds.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":20,"fort_misc":null,"ref":17,"ref_misc":null,"will":21,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":200,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":10,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 28","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 28 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.\n\n\n\nFor all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 30","level":11,"rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Creature","alignment":"NE","size":"Large","traits":["Uncommon","NE","Large","Dragon","Shadow"],"senses":["Perception +22","greater darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet"],"languages":["Common","Draconic","Shadowtongue"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":18,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Deception ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":22,"misc":null},{"name":"Nature ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":20,"misc":null},{"name":"Survival ","bonus":22,"misc":null}],"perception":22,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":7,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":5,"int_mod":3,"wis_mod":5,"cha_mod":3},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":31,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":22,"fort_misc":null,"ref":20,"ref_misc":null,"will":22,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":195,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["negative","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":null,"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 26","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 26 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.\n\n\n\nThankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__ (__Arcana__)**: DC 22","level":6,"rarity":"Common","type":"Creature","alignment":"CE","size":"Large","traits":["CE","Large","Cold","Dragon"],"senses":["Perception +13","darkvision","scent (imprecise) 60 feet","snow vision"],"languages":["Draconic"],"skills":[{"name":"Acrobatics ","bonus":10,"misc":null},{"name":"Arcana ","bonus":7,"misc":null},{"name":"Athletics ","bonus":16,"misc":null},{"name":"Intimidation ","bonus":12,"misc":null},{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":14,"misc":null}],"perception":13,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":6,"dex_mod":2,"con_mod":4,"int_mod":-1,"wis_mod":1,"cha_mod":0},"sense_abilities":[{"name":"Snow Vision","action_cost":"None","traits":null,"description":"Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","raw_description":"**Snow Vision** Snow doesn't impair a white dragon's vision; it ignores concealment from snowfall.","generic_description":null,"frequency":null,"trigger":null,"effect":null,"requirements":null,"range":null,"effects":null,"critical_success":null,"success":null,"failure":null,"critical_failure":null,"full_description":null}],"items":null,"ac":23,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":16,"fort_misc":null,"ref":14,"ref_misc":null,"will":11,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":115,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":["cold","paralyzed","sleep"],"resistances":[{"amount":5,"type":"fire"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Frightful Presence","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","emotion","fear","mental"],"description":"90 feet, DC 20","raw_description":"**Frightful Presence** 90 feet, DC 20 A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Although carnival barkers make any number of claims about this strange being's origins, the so-called \"moon mole\" is in fact an alien creature called a zuipnyrn, hailing from a distant planet beyond Golarion's star system.\n\n\n\nIn their infancy, zuipnyrns are spherical and furry, with few features other than a single eye stalk and a round, toothless feeding hole. A zuipnyrn's body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it—an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__ (__Occultism__)**: DC 23","level":3,"rarity":"Rare","type":"Creature","alignment":"N","size":"Small","traits":["Rare","N","Small","Aberration"],"senses":["Perception +9","greater darkvision"],"languages":["Common","(can't speak any language)"],"skills":[{"name":"Stealth ","bonus":11,"misc":null}],"perception":9,"ability_mods":{"str_mod":1,"dex_mod":3,"con_mod":3,"int_mod":-2,"wis_mod":2,"cha_mod":5},"sense_abilities":null,"items":null,"ac":20,"ac_special":null,"saves":{"fort":10,"fort_misc":null,"ref":10,"ref_misc":null,"will":7,"will_misc":null,"misc":null},"hp":35,"hp_misc":null,"immunities":null,"resistances":[{"amount":3,"type":"bludgeoning"}],"weaknesses":null,"automatic_abilities":[{"name":"Alluring Aspect","action_cost":"None","traits":["aura","occult","visual"],"description":"30 feet.
